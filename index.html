          I am currently studying computer science technology at Champlain College in St-Lambert,
          I am a curious, social and self-driven individual who seeks success in every sphere of his life.
          For the moment, my desire is to improve my programming skills and develop several projects covering various technologies.
          I challenge and surpass myself with the goal to exceed the employerâ€™s expectations.
          I approach and interact with others with ease and facility. I often bring to the table important ideas that lead to beneficial solutions when a problem occurs.
          I prioritize, listen and include my teammates' ideas in order to achieve desired results.
          As a team leader I establish the pros and con of a situation to find the preeminent solution.

              <p class="card-text">During the pendemic, I took the opportunity to offer my services as a web developper. I subscribed to a VM service, made myself a website and found a few clients. </p>
              <p>The main goal was and still is to better my web skills and get paid for it. Most of the websites I built for clients are made using the MEAN stack. They also use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api">Google Sheets API</a> to gather information like inventory or client submissions.</p>
              <p>In this project, I had to manage my expenses, deadlines, communication with clients and come up with representative brandings.</p>

              <p class="card-text">As part of my first project at Champlain College in my WebService class, I was advised to build a service of my choice reflecting the teachers' requirements.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I decided to make a Song Service which included an Artist & Genre service, an Album service, and a Ratings service. The database used for this project was MySQL and MongoDb</p>
              <p>The goal was to make multiple services with a Distributed Architecture which (REST & SOAP) allowed services to make HTTP requests between one another. </p>
              <p>This project consisted to be only backend using Docker to package my services into containers and standardized executed components. The software Postman was used to test the CRUD API calls. </p>

              <p>In this course, I had the task of building an innovative project using a basic Arduino starter kit. Consequently, I constructed a code that made LDE lights light up when the Ultrasonic Module would pick up the signal of my hand approaching the sensor.
                Furthermore, the temperature reader was able to read the temperature level when the sensor was in use. 
              </p>
              <p>The project was made in less than 24 hours for my final school project.</p>

              <p> However, this programming course allowed me to understand MVC and how to properly formulate requests to the TomCat server.</p>
              <p>In this project, the greatest challenge was properly understanding the calls to the servers and the functionning of the JSP structure.</p>
              <p>After all, this project's objective was to mainly focus on the backend, getting the main features working before implementing more features.
                 This JSP class granted me the opportunity to conceive a excellent database structure which included a Login page and an Account Creation.</p>
